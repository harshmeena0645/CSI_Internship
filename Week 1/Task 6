You are given a list of N lowercase English letters. For a given integer K, you can select any K indices (assume 1-based indexing) with a uniform probability from the list.

Find the probability that at least one of the K indices selected will contain the letter: 'a'.


from itertools import combinations

def probability_of_a(n, letters, k):
    indices = list(range(n))
    all_combinations = list(combinations(indices, k))
    
    total = len(all_combinations)
    favorable = 0
    
    for comb in all_combinations:
        if 'a' in [letters[i] for i in comb]:
            favorable += 1
    
    return round(favorable / total, 4)

n = int(input())
letters = input().split()
k = int(input())
print(probability_of_a(n, letters, k))
