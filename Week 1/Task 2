You are given a string S. Suppose a character 'c' occurs consecutively X times in the string. Replace these consecutive occurrences of the character 'c' with (X, c) in the string.



from itertools import groupby

S = input()
compressed = [(len(list(g)), int(k)) for k, g in groupby(S)]
print(' '.join(str(t) for t in compressed))
